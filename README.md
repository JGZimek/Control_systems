## Signal Tracking
Tracking a signal that changes over time in the presence of random disturbances with radical forgetting. Investigating the impact of the observation memory horizon on variance and bias. Studying the effect of disturbance variance on tracking quality and optimal horizon.

## Adaptive Control
Recursive algorithm for identifying non-stationary (time-varying) linear dynamic objects. Application of exponential forgetting. Optimization of the forgetting coefficient. Utilization of parameter tracking results for optimal control synthesis.

## Multi-level Control
Multilevel control of a complexly structured system with multiple connections. Model construction based on external measurements. Solving the problem of optimal control iteratively using a multilevel method with global constraints.
